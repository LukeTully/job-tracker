# Job Tracker
In the search for a new position, I realized that I could benefit from having a nice way of managing the jobs I applied to, and how far through the interview process I made it.

This uses localForage to store jobs, and Vuex to manage state, and Vue-router for routing. It's very much a work in progress, but it does provide the minimal set of requirements I set out initially.
## Project setup
```
